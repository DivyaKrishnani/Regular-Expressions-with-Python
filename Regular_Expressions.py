# ## REGULAR EXPRESSIONS 
# 
# Regular expressions are a tool for matching patterns in text.Regular expressions are used to sift through text-based data to find things. Regular expressions express a pattern of data that is to be located.
# 
# Some rules in regular expressions:
# 
# Identifiers:
# 
#     \d = any number
#     \D = anything but a number
#     \s = space
#     \S = anything but a space
#     \w = any letter
#     \W = anything but a letter
#     . = any character, except for a new line
#     \b = space around whole words
#     \. = period. must use backslash, because . normally means any character.
# 
# Modifiers:
# 
#     {1,3} = for digits, u expect 1-3 counts of digits, or "places"
#     + = match 1 or more
#     ? = match 0 or 1 repetitions.
#     * = match 0 or MORE repetitions
#     $ = matches at the end of string
#     ^ = matches start of a string
#     | = matches either/or. Example x|y = will match either x or y
#     [] = range, or "variance"
#     {x} = expect to see this amount of the preceding code.
#     {x,y} = expect to see this x-y amounts of the precedng code
# 
# White Space Charts:
# 
#     \n = new line
#     \s = space
#     \t = tab
#     \e = escape
#     \f = form feed
#     \r = carriage return
# 
# Characters to REMEMBER TO ESCAPE IF USED!
# 
#     . + * ? [ ] $ ^ ( ) { } | \
# 
# Brackets:
# 
#     [] = quant[ia]tative = will find either quantitative, or quantatative.
#     [a-z] = return any lowercase letter a-z
#     [1-5a-qA-Z] = return all numbers 1-5, lowercase letters a-q and uppercase A-Z
#     
#Example - 1 :
#A list of names and their corresponding ages can be obtaine dfrom a text
# In[1]:
